    prediction_confidence : "Prediction confidenceis the internal probability of class membership within the linear SVM model used by PICA (provided via Platt scaling). It can thus be seen as the confidence of the model in its prediction, given the data presented to it. Values for confidence range vom 0.5 (predictions are expected to be random) to 1 (PICA is highly confident with its prediction, given the set of input data)";
    mean_balanced_accuracy : "Mean Balanced Accuracyis a confidence measure computed from completeness/contamination of the uploaded bin and the model's known predictive power at the bin’s completeness and contamination level. It can thus be interpreted as our confidence in the predictions of the model, given the bin's completeness and contamination. Values of balanced accuracy may range from 0.5 (predictions are expected to be random) to 1 (high expected correlation of predicted class and actual class; also note the prediction confidence). We suggest this measure as the user’s main option for tuning sensitivity vs. specificity of PhenDB predictions, as it scales with completeness and contamination of your input data.";
