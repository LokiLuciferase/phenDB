    <h4>PhenDB is an automated pipeline for the prediction of microbial phenotypes based on comparative genomics.</h4>
    <br />
    <h1>Concept</h1>
    <br />
    Gene prediction by Prodigal (Hyatt et al., 2010) is run on the DNA sequence of the uploaded metagenomic bins or genomes.<br />
    Hmmer (Eddy et al., 2001) then searches orthologous groups from these protein sequences using the EggNOG DB (Huerta-Cepas et al., 2015).<br />
    Finally PICA (Feldbauer et al., 2015) uses support vector machine (SVM)-based models (calculated from genomes with known phenotypes) and the list of orthologous groups of proteins present in a bin/genome to predict whether the organism possesses a particular trait or not.<br />
    Currently, predictions for 44 different traits are calculated.<br /><br />
    Please note that PhenDB is still in an early stage of development and for several models we are still working on improving the training data.<br />
    Thus, please take note of the "balanced_accuracy" values ascribed to predictions.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <h1>How to Use PhenDB</h1>
    <br />
    You may either upload a single metagenomic bin/genome in FASTA format (.gz-compressed or uncompressed), or an archive (.tar.gz or .zip) containing several bins/genomes.<br />
    Alternatively, files and archives of files containing a proteome of a metagenomic bin (again in FASTA format) may be uploaded.<br /><br />
    Please note that a flat filestructure is required in the compressed folder.<br />
    The current maximum filesize for upload is 1 GB, the maximum file size per bin is 30 MB.<br />
    Duplicate sequence files (determined by file content) will be silently dropped from the analysis.<br />
    Empty sequence files will be silently dropped from the analysis.<br /><br />
    Balanced Accuracy is a confidence measure computed from completeness/contamination of the uploaded bin and the model's predictive power. Predictions with a balanced accuracy below the chosen cutoff value (range: 0.5 - 1) are omitted from the result.<br /><br />
    After submission, your job is queued and waits for completion of any previously submitted jobs.<br />
    When computation starts, expect about 1-1.5 min of calculation time per bin.<br />
    To receive a notification upon job completion, enter an email address during your submission.<br />
    Alternatively, you may save the URL to your submission to retrieve your results later.<br />
    Results are stored by PhenDB for 30 days - after which all user-uploaded data and associated results are deleted.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <h1>Output</h1>
    <br />
    PhenDB provides the output files in a .zip compressed folder named after your Job ID (i.e. the key after ../results/ in the URL). This folder contains:<br />
    <ul>
    <li>the folder individual_results, containing:</li>
        <ul>
        <li>a .results.txt file for every valid uploaded bin/genome.<br />This file contains the model names, predictions (YES/NO/NA) along with probability and balanced accuracy values.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>the folder "summaries", which contains:</li>
        <ul>
        <li>"summary_matrix.results.tsv": A summary file that shows for each model how many bins/genomes were predicted as "YES", "NO" or "N/A"</li>
        <li>"per_bin_matrix.results.tsv": A summary file that shows the verdict for each bin and each model as a matrix</li>
        <li>"invalid_input_files.log.txt": If one or more of your uploaded files were invalid (e.g. not in FASTA format), a warning will appear to check this file. If all files were correct, this file is empty.</li>
        <li>"PICA_trait_descriptions.txt": Contains the model names and the traits they are testing for.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
