Computational framework:
-Singularity or Docker container for perfect encapsulation and reproducibility ( )

Pipeline:

Web server:

Database ( ) (LL):
-better names for "model" model

Singularity:
- enable hmmer calculation inside container (remodel hmmc.py?)
- download models automatically

Other stuff:
- model: appear, disappear, change. Upon update: overwrite and check dates against dates in databases
