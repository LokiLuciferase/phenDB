###Global todo file for this project
##feel free to enter TODOs and sign in to stuff you are tackling

Computational framework:
-Singularity or Docker container for perfect encapsulation and reproducibility ( )


Pipeline:
-Allow .faa files to be processed (bypass prodigal with ifclause)
-Allow outputting of .faa files together with prediction

Web server:

Database ( ) (LL):
-better names for "model" model

Singularity:
- enable hmmer calculation inside container (remodel hmmc.py?)
- download models automatically
-

Other stuff:
- model: appear, disappear, change. Upon update: overwrite and check dates against dates in databases
-if there is a new enog version nr: wipe out the database. need a description of that.

Output:
-give information on important missing enogs when NO is predicted
