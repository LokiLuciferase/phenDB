# PhenDB

PhenDB is a publicly available resource able to screen user-provided assembled and binned metagenomes or genomes of cultivated isolates for 47 different bacterial traits. 

We use a support vector machine (SVM)-based machine learning approach trained with manually curated datasets based on gene presence/absence patterns for trait prediction.

Additionally, the user is provided with information about the estimated completeness, contamination and taxonomic placement of uploaded bins.
